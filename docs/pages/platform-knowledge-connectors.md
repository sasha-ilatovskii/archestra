Connectors pull data from external tools into knowledge bases on a schedule. Sync is incremental by default, so only new or changed content is processed after the first run. A connector can also be assigned to multiple knowledge bases.

This page focuses on connector-specific setup. Every connector also shares a few common fields in the UI:

- **Name** -- a label for your team
- **Description** -- optional context for other admins
- **Visibility** -- whether the connector is org-wide or team-scoped
- **Schedule** -- when sync runs automatically

Most connector-specific filters live under **Advanced** in the create/edit dialogs.

Connector visibility is part of the broader knowledge source access model. See [Overview - Visibility Modes](/docs/platform-knowledge-bases#visibility-modes) for how connector visibility determines which connector data each user can query.

## Jira

Ingests issue descriptions, comments, and metadata from Jira Cloud or Server.

| Field                   | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Base URL                | Your Jira instance URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net`) |
| Cloud Instance          | Toggle on for Jira Cloud, off for Jira Server/Data Center          |
| Project Key             | Filter issues to a single project (optional)                       |
| JQL Query               | Custom JQL to filter issues (optional)                             |
| Comment Email Blacklist | Comma-separated emails whose comments are excluded (optional)      |
| Labels to Skip          | Comma-separated issue labels to exclude (optional)                 |

Authentication uses an Atlassian account email and [API token](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens). Incremental sync uses JQL time-range queries on the `updated` field.

## Confluence

Ingests page content (HTML converted to plain text) from Confluence Cloud or Server.

| Field          | Description                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| URL            | Your Confluence instance URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki`) |
| Cloud Instance | Toggle on for Confluence Cloud, off for Server/Data Center                    |
| Space Keys     | Comma-separated space keys to sync (optional)                                 |
| Page IDs       | Comma-separated specific page IDs to sync (optional)                          |
| CQL Query      | Custom CQL to filter content (optional)                                       |
| Labels to Skip | Comma-separated labels to exclude (optional)                                  |
| Batch Size     | Pages per batch (default: 50)                                                 |

Authentication uses the same Atlassian email + API token as Jira. Incremental sync uses CQL `lastModified` queries.

## GitHub

Ingests issues, pull requests, and their comments from GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Server.

| Field                 | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub API URL        | API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.github.com` for GitHub.com, or your GHE API URL)               |
| Owner                 | GitHub organization or username that owns the repositories                                      |
| Repositories          | Comma-separated repository names to sync (optional -- leave blank to sync all org repositories) |
| Include Issues        | Toggle to sync issues and their comments (default: on)                                          |
| Include Pull Requests | Toggle to sync pull requests and their comments (default: on)                                   |
| Labels to Skip        | Comma-separated labels to exclude (optional)                                                    |

Authentication uses a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) (PAT). Incremental sync uses the `since` parameter on the issues API to fetch only items updated after the last sync.

## GitLab

Ingests issues, merge requests, and their comments from GitLab.com or self-hosted GitLab instances.

| Field                  | Description                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitLab URL             | Instance URL (e.g., `https://gitlab.com` or your self-hosted URL)                  |
| Group                  | GitLab group ID or path to scope project discovery (optional)                      |
| Project IDs            | Comma-separated specific project IDs to sync (optional -- leave blank to sync all) |
| Include Issues         | Toggle to sync issues and their comments (default: on)                             |
| Include Merge Requests | Toggle to sync merge requests and their comments (default: on)                     |
| Labels to Skip         | Comma-separated labels to exclude (optional)                                       |

Authentication uses a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/profile/personal_access_tokens/) (PAT). System-generated notes (assignment changes, label updates, etc.) are automatically filtered out. Incremental sync uses the `updated_after` parameter.

## Asana

Ingests tasks and their user comments from selected Asana projects. The connector syncs tasks returned by each project's task list; it does not separately traverse subtasks as child resources.

| Field         | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace GID | Your Asana workspace GID (found in the URL when viewing your workspace)                       |
| Project GIDs  | Comma-separated project GIDs to sync (optional -- leave blank to sync all workspace projects) |
| Tags to Skip  | Comma-separated tag names to exclude (optional)                                               |

Authentication uses a [personal access token](https://developers.asana.com/docs/personal-access-token) (PAT). Task descriptions and user comments are indexed from the rich-text HTML fields (`html_notes`, `html_text`) so @-mentions and formatting are preserved; empty @-mention anchors are rendered as `[@asana:<gid>]` markers so references are not silently lost. System-generated stories are filtered out -- only user comments are indexed. Incremental sync filters tasks client-side by their `modified_at` field against the last run's checkpoint, and rate-limited (429) responses are retried with `Retry-After` honored.

When explicit `Project GIDs` are provided, each project's workspace is verified to match `Workspace GID` — mismatched projects fail fast rather than silently syncing from another workspace the token can see.

## ServiceNow

Ingests records from ServiceNow instances via the Table API. HTML descriptions are converted to plain text. Multiple entity types can be enabled via toggles.

| Field                         | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Instance URL                  | Your ServiceNow instance URL (e.g., `https://your-instance.service-now.com`)                                                  |
| Include Incidents             | Sync incidents from the `incident` table (default: on)                                                                        |
| Include Changes               | Sync change requests from the `change_request` table (default: off)                                                           |
| Include Change Tasks          | Sync change tasks from the `change_task` table (default: off)                                                                 |
| Include Problems              | Sync problems from the `problem` table (default: off)                                                                         |
| Include Business Applications | Sync business applications from the `cmdb_ci_business_app` CMDB table (default: off)                                          |
| States                        | Comma-separated state values to filter by (e.g. `1, 2`). Applies to incidents, changes, change tasks, and problems (optional) |
| Assignment Groups             | Comma-separated assignment group sys_ids to filter by. Does not apply to business applications (optional)                     |
| Batch Size                    | Records per batch (default: 50)                                                                                               |

Authentication supports both basic auth (username + password) and OAuth bearer tokens. When using basic auth, provide the username in the Email field and the password in the API Token field. For OAuth, leave the Email field empty and provide the bearer token. Incidents are synced by default; enable additional entity types in the advanced configuration. States and assignment group filters apply to all entity types except business applications. Incremental sync uses the `sys_created_on` field to fetch only records created since the last run.

## Notion

Ingests pages from Notion workspaces using the Notion API. Page content is fetched from Notion blocks and converted to plain text.

| Field        | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database IDs | Comma-separated Notion database IDs to sync (optional -- leave blank to sync all accessible pages)      |
| Page IDs     | Comma-separated specific Notion page IDs to sync (optional -- takes precedence over Database IDs)       |

Authentication uses a [Notion integration token](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) (starts with `secret_`). Create an internal integration in your Notion workspace and share the relevant pages or databases with it. Incremental sync uses the `last_edited_time` field to fetch only pages modified since the last run.

## SharePoint

Ingests documents and site pages from SharePoint Online via the Microsoft Graph API. Text is extracted from `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.yaml`, `.log` files, as well as `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx` documents. Site pages are synced with content extracted from web parts. When a multimodal embedding model is configured (e.g., `gemini-embedding-2-preview`), image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) up to 4 MB are also ingested and embedded directly.

| Field         | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tenant ID     | Your Azure AD (Entra ID) tenant ID or domain (e.g., `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)       |
| Site URL      | Your SharePoint site URL (e.g., `https://your-tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/your-site`)             |
| Client ID     | Azure AD app registration Application (client) ID                                                  |
| Client Secret | Azure AD app registration client secret value                                                      |
| Drive IDs     | Comma-separated document library IDs to sync (optional -- leave blank to sync all site libraries)   |
| Folder Path   | Restrict sync to a specific folder path within each drive (optional)                                |
| Recursive     | Traverse subfolders within each drive or Folder Path (default: on)                                  |
| Include Pages | Toggle to sync site pages and their web part content (default: on)                                  |

The `maxDepth` field is available via the API for programmatic connector creation but is not exposed in the UI. When Recursive is enabled, traversal descends up to 50 levels by default (range: 1--100).

Authentication uses an Azure AD app registration with client credentials (OAuth2). The app registration requires the `Sites.Read.All` application permission on Microsoft Graph, and admin consent must be granted.

To configure the connector:

- `Tenant ID` comes from **Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > <your app> > Overview > Directory (tenant) ID**
- `Client ID` comes from **Application (client) ID** on the same page
- `Client Secret` is the secret **Value** from **Certificates & secrets**, not the secret ID
- `Site URL` should be the exact SharePoint site web URL, not just the display name

Incremental sync uses the `lastModifiedDateTime` field to fetch only items modified since the last run.

## Google Drive

Ingests files from Google Drive (My Drive and Shared Drives) via the Google Drive API. Text is extracted from `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.yaml`, `.log` files, as well as `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx` documents. Google Workspace files (Docs, Sheets, Slides) are exported as plain text. When a multimodal embedding model is configured, image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) are also ingested and embedded directly.

| Field                 | Description                                                                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Drive IDs             | Comma-separated shared drive IDs to sync (optional -- providing Drive IDs automatically enables shared-drive API access; leave blank to sync from My Drive) |
| Folder ID             | Restrict sync to a specific folder (optional -- find the ID in the folder's Google Drive URL)      |
| File Types            | Comma-separated file extensions to include, e.g. `.pdf, .docx` (optional -- leave blank for all)  |
| Recursive Traversal   | Sync files from all nested subfolders when a Folder ID is set (default: on)                        |

Authentication supports two modes via the **Service Account Key / OAuth Token** field:

1. **Service account JSON key** (recommended for production): Create a service account in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable the Google Drive API, download the JSON key file, and paste its entire contents into the token field. Share the target folders/drives with the service account email address.
2. **OAuth2 access token**: Paste a short-lived OAuth2 access token with the `drive.readonly` scope. Useful for quick testing but tokens expire after ~1 hour.

To configure the connector:

- Enable the **Google Drive API** in your Google Cloud project
- Create a **Service account** and download its JSON key
- **Share** the target Drive folders with the service account email (as Viewer)
- Paste the full JSON key contents into the token field
- Optionally set a **Folder ID** to scope the sync to a specific folder

Known limitations:

- Google Workspace files (Docs, Sheets, Slides) are exported as plain text, which may lose formatting.
- File size limit for text extraction is 10 MB.
- Recursive traversal is bounded to a depth of 50 levels by default (configurable via the `maxDepth` API field, range 1--100).

Incremental sync uses the `modifiedTime` field with a 5-minute safety buffer to fetch only files modified since the last run.

## Dropbox

Ingests files from Dropbox accounts or team folders using the Dropbox API v2. Text is extracted from `.md`, `.txt`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.html`, `.css`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.sh`, `.toml`, `.ini`, and `.conf` files.

| Field       | Description                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Root Path   | Folder path to scope the sync (e.g., `/team-docs`). Leave blank to sync the entire account.     |
| File Types  | Comma-separated file extensions to include (e.g., `.md, .txt`). Leave blank to sync all supported types. |

The `recursive` and `maxDepth` fields are available via the API for programmatic connector creation but are not exposed in the UI. By default all subfolders are traversed recursively up to 50 levels deep.

Authentication uses a Dropbox access token. Generate one from the [Dropbox App Console](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) by creating an app with `files.content.read` permission.

Incremental sync uses the `list_folder/continue` cursor API. After the first full sync, only changed files are fetched using the cursor saved from the previous run.

## Linear

Ingests Linear issues by default, with optional project and cycle sync in advanced settings. Content includes issue descriptions, optional comment threads, project content/updates, and cycle summaries.

| Field            | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear API URL   | GraphQL API base URL (default: `https://api.linear.app`)                 |
| Team IDs         | Comma-separated team IDs to scope sync (optional)                        |
| Project IDs      | Comma-separated project IDs to scope sync (optional)                     |
| Issue States     | Comma-separated issue state names (e.g. `Todo, In Progress, Done`)       |
| Include Comments | Include issue comments in indexed content (default: on)                  |
| Include Projects | Sync projects and recent project updates as documents (default: off)     |
| Include Cycles   | Sync cycles as documents (default: off)                                  |
| Batch Size       | Items fetched per request (optional, defaults to connector implementation) |

Authentication uses a Linear personal API key passed as a bearer token in connector credentials.

To create credentials:

1. Open Linear.
2. Go to **Settings -> Security & access -> Personal API keys**.
3. Create a key for Archestra.
4. Store it securely and paste it into the connector **Personal Access Token** field in Archestra.

To collect filter IDs (optional):

- Team IDs: open a team page in Linear and copy the team ID from GraphQL/API tooling or workspace admin views.
- Project IDs: open a project and copy the project ID from GraphQL/API tooling.
- States: use exact workflow state names as they appear in the team workflow (for example `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Done`).

Incremental behavior:

- Issue sync runs with `updatedAt`-based incremental filtering and preserves a stable lower bound during pagination.
- Project/cycle sync (when enabled) also uses `updatedAt` incremental checkpoints.
- First run performs an initial backfill for selected scope; subsequent runs only ingest changed resources.

Operational notes:

- Keep `Batch Size` moderate if your workspace has high activity to reduce GraphQL rate-limit pressure.
- If both project and cycle toggles are enabled, connector runs issue sync first, then projects, then cycles.
- Updating connector config resets checkpoint and triggers a full resync on the next run.

## Managing Connectors

Connectors can be managed from either the **Connectors** page or a knowledge base's detail page. After creation you can:

- **Toggle enabled/disabled** -- suspends or resumes the cron schedule
- **Trigger sync** -- runs an immediate sync outside the schedule
- **View runs** -- see sync history with status, document counts, and errors

## Adding New Connector Types

See [Adding Knowledge Connectors](/docs/platform-adding-knowledge-connectors) for a developer guide on implementing new connector types.
